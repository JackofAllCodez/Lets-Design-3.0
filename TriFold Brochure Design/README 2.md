# TriFold Brochure Design

**OPEN TO ALL** **No need to claim this issue** **NO SUBMISSION WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER 8th January 11:59 P.M.**

This Task is for you to show off your Visual Design Skills and Minimal Thinking. 
A brochure isÂ **a corporate marketing instrument used to promote a product or service offering**. It is a tool that is used to circulate information about the product or service. A brochure is like a magazine but with pictures of the product or the service which the brand is promoting.

In this task, you have to design a **TriFold brochure for a travel company**. Which must have been pretty much clear by the name of the issue. 

> ðŸ’¡ This task need be done in **Adobe Illustrator** or **Figma** [ Use standard business card Frame size i.e., **2550 Ã— 3300 px** ].

## Submission Guidelines:

For Submission you would have to provide the *link to the figma frame,* if doing in figma or *Upload the illustrator file*, if doing in Illustrator in a text file and make sure to keep the file in "**TriFold Brochure Design"** folder only. Also add jpg or png file of your work in the PR.

Any kind of plagiarism will not be supported. You can take inspiration(a image is added below for inspration), but the idea must be unique. 

> This task is for **50 Points**.

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The brochure should obviously look like a brochure and not like any other form of print media. Since it is a 40 point task we are expecting proper use of two of the design principles: Alignment and Proximity. This includes visual connection of elements with each other, arrangement of content in logical groups and proper utilisation of white space. The brochure should not look cluttered, while also not missing on the important contents. It should have extremely well defined order of importance of hierarchy.

For any doubts related to the task or the submission process you can always ping us on discord. We will be happy to help.
