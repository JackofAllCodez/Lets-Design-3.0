## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The business card should obviously look like a business card and not like any other form of print media. Since it is a 30 point task we are expecting proper use of two of the design principles: Alignment and Proximity. This includes visual connection of elements with each other, arrangement of content in logical groups and proper utilisation of white space. The card should not look cluttered, while also not missing on the important contents. It should have extremely well defined order of importance of hierarchy.
