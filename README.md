## üßæCommon Rules:

- The repository is divided into several tasks. **Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only.** NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
- The mentors will evaluate the submissions and assign points for each specific task¬†based on a variety of design-related factors, such as the use of design thinking, the uniqueness of the idea, the submission's visual attractiveness, etc.
- Since everyone should be awarded for their efforts, the participants who qualify for the **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)** as mentioned in the respective folders of the task will be awarded Full Pointsüéâ
- Since the goals of these tasks are learning design rather than only earning points, any plagiarism or attempt at it will be frowned upon and will result in disqualification from OpenCode. You can always ping us with questions, and we'll be pleased to answer them, but merely duplicating other people's ideas to finish the jobs will be strongly prohibited.

> ALL THE FINAL DECISIONS FOR THE JUDGMENT AND AWARDING OF POINTS ‚öñÔ∏è BASED ON THE SUBMISSION RESIDE WITH THE MENTORS & ORGANISERS.
No claim can be made on the number of points awarded by the Mentors & OrganisersüôÇ.
